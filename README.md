# Description:

This web scrapper was born out of an exciting idea I had during a long plane flight. Its purpose is to provide live updates on the status of projects that someone is invested in on the Ethereum network, specifically on the openSea marketplace. This project is actually an extension of a previous project I worked on [here](https://github.com/ahmadank/OpenSea-webScrapper/), but with the added benefit of using React and Next.js 13 to enhance its functionality.

### `Goals`

- Create a website that retrieves useful information about a project
- Support adding and dropping of new projects.
- Display the data in a clean way

### `Problems`

- Website owners often time hate web scrapping, for that I were not able to retrieve info such as quantity of items being sold.

### `Ideas`

- The website currently relies on cookies to keep user info stored, for that I need a backup option. Generating an option for the user to enter his secret id will allow the user to restore his projects
