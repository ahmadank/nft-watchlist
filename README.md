# Description:

This web scrapper was born out of an exciting idea I had during a long plane flight. Its purpose is to provide live updates on the status of projects that someone is invested in on the Ethereum network, specifically on the openSea marketplace. This project is actually an extension of a previous project I worked on [here](https://github.com/ahmadank/OpenSea-webScrapper/), but with the added benefit of using React and Next.js 13 to enhance its functionality.

### `Goals`

- Create a website that retrieves useful information about a project
- Support adding and dropping of new projects.
- Display the data in a clean way

### `Problems`

- Website owners often dislike web scraping, which can prevent me from obtaining information such as the number of items sold.

### `Where we at`

- The website is currently hosted on [Vercel](https://nft-watchlist-gamma.vercel.app/) and is ready for beta use. However the website remains uncomplete as apple and google authentications are not implemented and we are still waiting for an API token from OpenSea to display more info on the project
